Room is an Android persistence library that is part of Google’s Android Jetpack project. According to the documentation, Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

There are 3 major components in Room:

    Database: Contains the database holder and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app’s persisted, relational data.
    Entity: Represents a table within the database.
    DAO: Contains the methods used for accessing the database.
